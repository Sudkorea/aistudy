## 1. Efficient Multimodal Reasoning with Sparse Expert Routing
- Recommendation score: **20.32**
- Link: https://huggingface.co/papers/2502.00001

We introduce a sparse routing strategy for multimodal LLMs that reduces compute while maintaining reasoning quality on vision-language benchmarks.

## 2. Retrieval-Augmented Agents for Scientific Discovery
- Recommendation score: **15.2**
- Link: https://huggingface.co/papers/2502.00003

We present an agent framework combining structured retrieval and tool use for iterative hypothesis generation in scientific domains.

## 3. Post-Training Alignment via Preference Distillation
- Recommendation score: **12.84**
- Link: https://huggingface.co/papers/2502.00002

A practical distillation recipe that transfers alignment signals from large policy models to compact open models using synthetic preference pairs.

## 4. Benchmarking Open Foundation Models for Korean NLP
- Recommendation score: **12.76**
- Link: https://huggingface.co/papers/2502.00005

A comprehensive benchmark suite for Korean NLP tasks with reproducible recipes and multilingual transfer analysis.
